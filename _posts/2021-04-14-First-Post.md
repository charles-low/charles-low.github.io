I was not a guy who very keen to blog. However I found myself is lagging behind from the bleeding edge technologies after multiple years of striving in consulting and advisory career in Hong Kong, and it is, to be honest, not an easy task to pick up all the knowledge left behind as the technologies are evolving rapidly in recent years. Therefore I changed my mind, trying to document things that I learnt, so I can better recall what I've done before.

All technical notes are stored in something formatted like gitbook, but it sounds a bit dull if the journery of my learning was not recorded in a time series of posts, which sharing a bit of knowledge at one time. Therefore in parallel to that gitbook, I should be setting up a blog too. This is the reason of this blog exists.

Secondly, all these efforts also comes with a selfish reason. It is not a common practice to setup your blog, repo, or projects as part of your career profile in Hong Kong, but it seems not the case in more (technologically / politically) advanced countries. Given the status of Hong Kong now, it is late better than never to build up my blog, just in case I needed it in near future.

Besides, I'm also setting this blog purely using iPad Air. This blog is built using jekyll + github, and all is done without using any PC / macbook. It feels so cool when everything can be done on a tablet and blog post is written using markdown and published with git.
